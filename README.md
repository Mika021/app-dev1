# My favorite is Descendants of the Sun. 
**Descendants of the Sun** is a drama that tells of the love story that develops between a surgeon and a special forces officer. A love story develops between Captain Yoo Shi Jin, of the South Korean Special Forces, and Doctor Kang Mo Yeon, who works as a surgeon at Haesung Hospital in Seoul. They will find themselves in the middle of great events and deadly dangers, both in their motherland and in the fictitious, war-torn country of Urk
